# Maps of Cities and Weather

Part 1 Weather

The project begins by generating a list of random coordinates across the world, that are cross referenced with a geolocation API to determine the closest city. These locations are then referenced in a search on a weather API to find the corresponding local weather data. The results are displayed in a series of graphs to identify trends in the data.

Part 2 Vacation

The cities are narrowed down based on their max temperature and their weather data is plotted on the map. The city names are then implemented as search parameters with the Google Places API to find the closest hotel. The hotels are then plotted on the same map.
